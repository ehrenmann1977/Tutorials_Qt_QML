# Qt_QML_QtQuick_communication
This project illustrates the following how to

1- connect UI Component to QtQuick for separating the ui from the logic
2- connect QtQuick object's signal to C++ function to update the c++ backend with a new x-coordinate
3- connect C++ signal to QtQuick signal (signal-signal) so that we can read data from Qt Quick functions from C++ logic backend
4- all QML objects memory pointers are encapsulated into a QMAP from the main.cpp so that we can read any function from QML from C++ subclasses
